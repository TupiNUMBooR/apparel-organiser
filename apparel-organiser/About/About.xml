  <description>Ever get tired of the clicking you have to do in the apparel menu?

This organizes most apparels in two groups: civilian apparel or combat apparel. Under those groups there are apparel inner or outer, accessories, hats, masks, helmets, body armor, exohelmets, and exosuits. Custom categories for Star Wars and Tiberium Rim mods.

This patch is safe to add and remove in existing games.

Load this at the end of you mod list.
